### 1. Project Overview

**Overview**

For many online businesses, the 20/80 rule of marketing holds true: 20% of the customer account for 80% of the revenue. Therefore, it is vital for businesses to come up with a marketing strategy to target these customers and attract similar ones. As the first step, businesses need to be able to identify these valuable customers and understand what are the common characteristics among them. Such characteristics might even become growth drivers for online sales.

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to build a model that can predict profitable customers from online sales data. I will analyze and use data from a Google Merchandise Store (GStore), which sells Google merchandise such as shirts or hats. The datasets are available on [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction). 

The aim is twofold: first, from data analysis and modelling, I hope to extract insights into which customer and app features contribute most to revenue. Second, I hope to develop a model that can predict potential revenue from a customer. These predictions can then be used for targeted marketing.

The project also has a secondary objective. I will use this project to understand more about what kinds of data and features are available from Google Analytics.

**Success Criteria**

The target for prediction is the natural log of the per-user revenue:

The success criteria is to achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.9 on a chosen test set.
